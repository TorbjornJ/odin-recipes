    <h2>How to make Garfield Ice Cream</h2>
    <p>Grab your Garcat for this cause it's gon' be a hoot and a holler.<br>There are two certainties that we know about Garfield, Jim Davis’ prized comic cat creation: He hates Mondays and he loves lasagna. However, why lasagna of all foods? It turns out that Davis himself is a big fan of lasagna and, as he says, “I thought it would be funny to have a cat that likes lasagna, but as it turns out, I hear from people all the time that their cats love lasagna.”</p>
    <p>While Davis has since gone on to say that he wishes he’d made pizza Garfield’s favorite food, as lasagna proved difficult to draw, the gluttonous feline will always be remembered for his love of the baked and layered pasta dish (amongst many other foods). This Garfield detail, though, raises some questions and for the sake of cats, lasagna aficionados and the people of Muncie, IN, we need answers. In honor of today being Garfield Day, which is celebrated annually on June 19th, the same day that Garfield first ran in 1978, here are Garfield lasagna.</p>
